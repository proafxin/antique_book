# Antique Book

An antique style for LaTeX documents. Try to place the files in the project directory rather than putting them in the texlive/miktex installation directory to make it globally accessible. Otherwise you may break your system.

Background is commented out by default. If you want to use a stained background to make it look like it was printed on some old printer, uncomment the last 3 lines in the class file.
